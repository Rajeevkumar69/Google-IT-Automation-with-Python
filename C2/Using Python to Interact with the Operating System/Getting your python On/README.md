**Getting Famillier with operating system:~**

_Microsoft Windows isn't an Open-Source OS._

The operating system is a software that manages everything that goes on in the computer.

There are two main parts of an operating system: the kernel and the user space.

The major operating systems used in IT today are Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

Linux is an open source operating system, which means it is free to share, modify, and distribute.

Python is a cross-platform language, which means it can be used on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and other operating systems.

In this course, we will be using Linux and Python to interact with the operating system.

**Getting Your Computer Ready for Python**

_pip the name of the command line tool commonly used to install, update, and remove external Python modules._

The best way to learn Python is to practice by running the scripts on your computer.

To run Python locally, you need to have it installed on your computer.

You can check whether you already have Python installed by running the Python --version command .

If you don't have Python installed, you can install it from the Python website.

After installing Python, you can install additional modules that aren't part of the Python Standard Library.

These additional modules can be found on the Python Package Index (PyPI).

You can install, update, and remove external modules using the pip command line tool.

**Setting up Your Environment on Windows (Optional)**
Windows computers do not come with Python preinstalled.

To do this, we will download the executable installer for Python 3 64-bit architecture.

Once the installer has downloaded, we will run it as an administrator user.

We will need to check the "Add Python 3.7 to Path" box before clicking "Install now".

This will ensure that the Python interpreter is executed when we invoke it from the command line.

After Python has been installed, we can test to see that it worked by opening a new PowerShell and executing the command "python --version".

If Python is installed correctly, we will see the version number of the interpreter.

We can also check to see if the request module is installed by importing it into the interpreter.

If the module is not installed, we can install it using Pip.

To do this, we will run the command "pip install request" from the command line.

Once the module is installed, we can import it into the interpreter and use it to interact with web services.
_Here are some additional tips for installing Python on Windows:_

Make sure that you download the correct version of Python for your computer.

If you are not sure which version of Python to download, you can check the system requirements for your computer.

You can also install Python from the Microsoft Store. This is a convenient option, but it may not include all of the latest features and bug fixes.

If you are having trouble installing Python, you can search for help online or contact the Python community for support.
