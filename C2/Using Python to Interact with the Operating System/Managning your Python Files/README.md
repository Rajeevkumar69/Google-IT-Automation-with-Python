**Managning files with Python**

In this module, we will learn how to use Python to interact with file systems. We will learn about absolute and relative paths, and how to use Python to manipulate files and directories. We will also look at a specific file format called CSV that we can use to read and write data.

In the previous module, we learned about Python programming basics, including how to install Python, set up a programming environment, and write and execute Python scripts. We also discussed when to consider automation and what problems we might encounter when doing that.

we learned how to open, read, and display a file in Python. We saw that we can use the open() function to create a file object and then use the readline() or read() methods to read the contents of the file. We also learned that it's important to close files after we're finished using them to avoid race conditions and to free up file system resources. Finally, we saw that we can use the with statement to automatically close a file after we're finished with it.

In this video, we learned how to open, read, and display a file in Python. We saw that we can use the open() function to create a file object and then use the readline() or read() methods to read the contents of the file. We also learned that it's important to close files after we're finished using them to avoid race conditions and to free up file system resources. Finally, we saw that we can use the with statement to automatically close a file after we're finished with it.

Here are some of the key takeaways from this video:-.

To open a file in Python, we can use the open() function.

The open() function takes two arguments: the name of the file to open and the mode in which we want to open the file.

The most common modes for opening files are "r" (read), "w" (write), and "a" (append).

Once we have a file object, we can use the readline() or read() methods to read the contents of the file.

The readline() method reads a single line from the file, while the read() method reads the entire file.

It's important to close files after we're finished using them to avoid race conditions and to free up file system resources.

We can use the with statement to automatically close a file after we're finished with it.

**Iterating file with python**

To iterate through a file line by line, you can use the readline() function and a for loop.

To remove the newline character from the end of a line, you can use the strip() method.

To read the contents of a file into a list, you can use the readlines() method.

To display characters that are not printable, you can use escape sequences.

When reading large files, it is more efficient to process them line by line.

**Writing Files**
To write to a file in Python, we can use the write() method on a file object.

The write() method takes a string as its argument and writes that string to the file.

The file object can be opened in several different modes, including w, a, and r+.

The w mode opens the file for writing only. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If the file does exist, its contents will be overwritten.

The a mode opens the file for appending. Any data written to the file will be added to the end of the existing contents.
The r+ mode opens the file for both reading and writing.

The write() method returns the number of characters that were written to the file.

**Working with Files**

we learned how to delete, rename, and check if a file exists using the OS module in Python. The OS module provides a layer of abstraction between Python and the underlying system so that we can interact with the operating system without knowing which operating system we're working on. We can use the remove function to delete a file, the rename function to rename a file, and the exists function to check if a file exists.

The exists function is super useful because we can use it to check that a file exists before trying to read it or verify that it doesn't exist before trying to write it, which helps us avoid losing any data.

**More File Information**

We can use the getsize function to get the size of a file in bytes.

We can use the getmtime function to get the last modification time of a file.

The getmtime function returns a Unix timestamp, which represents the number of seconds since January 1st, 1970.

We can use the datetime module to convert a Unix timestamp to a human-readable date and time.

The abspath function takes a filename and turns it into an absolute path.

The absolute path specifies the exact location of a file on the filesystem.

There are many other functions in the OS and OSpath modules that let us work with files.

You can find a link to the documentation for these functions in the next reading.

**Directories**

Python provides a number of functions to create, delete, and browse directories.

The getcwd function can be used to check the current working directory.

The mkdir function can be used to create a directory.

The chdir function can be used to change the current working directory.

The rmdir function can be used to remove a directory, but only if it is empty.

The os.listdir function can be used to get a list of the contents of a directory.

The os.path.isdir function can be used to check if a file or directory exists.

The os.path.join function can be used to join two strings, such as a directory name and a file name.

**What is a CSV file?**
_Comma Seprated Values_.

CSV files are a common data format used to store data as segments of text separated by commas.

The Python standard library includes a module for working with CSV files, which can be used to read and write CSV files.

The csv.reader() function takes a file object as its argument and returns a reader object.

The reader object has a next() method that returns the next row in the CSV file as a list.

Each row in the CSV file is a list of values, where each value is separated by a comma.

To iterate through a CSV file, you can use a for loop to call the next() method on the reader object.

The CSV module in Python can be used to generate CSV files.

To generate a CSV file, you can use the csv.writer() function to create a writer object.
